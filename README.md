# Ctrl + Alt + Defeat: Where Bugs Come to Die

I'm a passionate .NET Developer from Portugal. Since 2019, I've been dedicated to building robust and scalable applications.

Currently, I'm chasing unicorns with my startup [scalizup](https://github.com/scalizup). Wish me luck, mate!

When I'm not coding, you can find me doing absolutely nothing productive, unless you count watching my code run flawlessly as productive. I also enjoy long walks... to the fridge.
