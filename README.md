# Ctrl + Alt + Defeat: Where Bugs Come to Die

I'm a passionate .NET Developer from Portugal, focusing on .NET and HTMX. Since 2019, I've been dedicated to building robust and scalable applications.

Currently, I'm on an exciting journey to launch my own business. Check it out: [scalizup](https://github.com/scalizup).

When I'm not coding, you can find me doing absolutely nothing productive, unless you count watching my code run flawlessly as productive. I also enjoy long walks... to the fridge.
